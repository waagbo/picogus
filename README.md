# PicoGUS THT

<img src="picogus-logo.svg" width="500" alt="PicoGUS">

PicoGUS is a Raspberry Pi Pico based ISA sound card for DOS and Win9x retro computers.
The brilliant firmware makes it a highly versatile clone card that provides near perfect emulation of the major sound cards from that era.

Additional features like CD-ROM (Panasonic MKE), MPU-401 and USB game controllers build further on the cards versatility and the wavetable header will further extend the capacity with a card like [X2GS from Serdaco](https://serdashop.com/products/x2gs-te) to get the original Roland magic or even a [WavetablePi](https://github.com/scrapcomputing/WavetablePiHoriz) for the ultimate all-in-one experience for MS-DOS games. 

**PicoGUS THT is a through-hole conversion of the [PicoGUS project](https://github.com/polpo/picogus).**<br />
It provides versions with as many Through-Hole components as possible and adding convenience where possible.
The design goal is to make the project be easier to solder by hand as well as giving it a higher level of retro asthetics.

The designs still have some SMD components as they do not have THT equivalents. The only TSSOP package is the two *SN74CB3T3257PWR* level shifters (U3/U4). They do however feature a redesigned footprint to help with debugging.



**Version 1.3** is an extension of the PicoGUS 1.2 design implementing the v1.3 features from the *hw-hand386* branch.
The addition of a *Wavetable* header and a full size USB-A connector accessible from the back gives the 1.2 design some sought after upgrades.

The board has also been resized to optimize for component placement and JCLPCB pricing.<br/>
The initial design idea has been built and tested. The release version v1.3.2 is still pending build/test.
<br/>

**Version 2.1** is an experimental extension of the PicoGUS 2.0 SMD design, made possible using a Waveshare Core2350B board to free enough I/O ports for the 2.0 feature set. This is still in the design phase.
<br/>

**Experimental Software Features** that adds upon community ideas:
* DFS drive support inspired by PicoMEM so the USB drive can be accessed from MS-DOS.

<br/>




**A big thank you to [Ian Scott (polpo)](https://github.com/polpo/) for the PicoGUS design and his contributions to the retro community.**<br/>**May his work set an example for future open-source hardware projects.**

## PicoGUS

The original PicoGUS project is found at [polpo/pigocus](https://github.com/polpo/picogus) or www.picogus.com.<br/>
Here are the original README.md to give some more information about the great features of the PicoGUS:

ISA sound card and CD-ROM drive emulation on the Raspberry Pi Pico's RP2040 microcontroller. PicoGUS can emulate:

* [Gravis Ultrasound (GUS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravis_Ultrasound) - the primary focus of PicoGUS, hence the name
* [Sound Blaster 16](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster_16) (OPL3) / [Sound Blaster Pro 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_Blaster#Sound_Blaster_Pro_2,_CT1600) (OPL3) / [AdLib](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ad_Lib,_Inc.) (OPL2)
* [MPU-401 (with intelligent mode)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPU-401) - outputs MIDI data on 3.5mm MIDI TRS connector
* [Tandy 3-voice](http://www.vgmpf.com/Wiki/index.php?title=Tandy_3_Voice)
* [CMS/Game Blaster](http://nerdlypleasures.blogspot.com/2012/10/all-you-ever-wanted-to-know-about.html)
* [Game port joystick](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_port)
* [Panasonic/MKE CD-ROM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panasonic_CD_interface)

Current status: perpetual beta! See the [main wiki page](https://github.com/polpo/picogus/wiki) for current status and the [compatibility list](https://github.com/polpo/picogus/wiki/Compatibility-list) for support status of various DOS programs and other system compatibility notes. This project has a heavy demoscene focus due to the GUS's history so that's what I've concentrated on, but GUS support in games is very good to excellent.

Want to buy a PicoGUS? Fully assembled PicoGUS 2.0 sound cards are available from these sources, all of whom ship worldwide:

* [Joe's Computer Museum Shop](https://jcm-1.com/product/picogus-v2/) - in US 🇺🇸
* [Serdashop](https://www.serdashop.com/PicoGUS) - in EU 🇪🇺
* [Flamelily IT](https://shop.flamelily.co.uk/picogus) - in UK 🇬🇧

Want to make your own PicoGUS? See the [build guide](https://github.com/polpo/picogus/wiki/Building-your-PicoGUS). Note that the more DIY friendly v1.1.1 hardware has some documented issues with reset – a forthcoming v1.2 revision will fix these issues. **Important caveat**: due to the specs of the Pico, assumptions made by programs written to use the GUS, the imprecise nature of emulation, and the varying specs of retro DOS PC hardware, some things will likely never be perfect. **This is still a work in progress.**

Have a PicoGUS and want to use it? See the [configuring and using your PicoGUS guide](https://github.com/polpo/picogus/wiki/Configuring-and-using-your-PicoGUS).

Want to support PicoGUS? I have a limited number of machines to test PicoGUS in and donating either money or motherboards would be greatly appreciated and help increase the compatibility of PicoGUS.
