# PicoGUS THT (through-hole) v1.3.2 (work in progress) – based on PicoGUS v1.2

Board revision **v1.3.2**: the [v1.3.1 (rev B) THT board](../hw-tht-v1.3.1/README.md) on a 102 mm outline, with
the fine-pitch chips soldered straight to the card and a test pad on every one of their pins.

* **U3/U4** (SN74CB3T3257, TSSOP-16) and **U9** (PCM5100A, TSSOP-20) only exist as TSSOPs. They are soldered to
  the card on hand-solder footprints, and **every pin has its own 0.7 mm round test pad** in line with it, for a
  probe, a meter or a scope (see [U3/U4 and U9 with a test pad per pin](#u3u4-and-u9-with-a-test-pad-per-pin)).
  The TSSOP-to-DIP adapter boards of the earlier v1.3.2 layout are gone, and so are their sockets.
* **The GY-PCM5102 module option (J10) is gone.** The on-board DAC is always fitted.
* **New placement** of the DAC block, the mixer and the jacks (2026-10-31): the DAC sits above the Pico with its
  digital side facing it, the mixer above the DAC, MIDI OUT at the top of the bracket end and LINE OUT below WT VOL
  (see [Placement](#placement)).
* **C36** (U9 charge-pump decoupling) is a through-hole 0.1 µF disc, and all eight DAC decoupling discs sit on the
  side of U9 where their pins are (see [DAC decoupling](#dac-decoupling)).
* **C8/C10** (U8 PSRAM decoupling) are the v1.3.1 through-hole discs, next to U8.
* **1.84 mm shorter**: 102.0 mm long over the outline (v1.3.1: 103.8 mm), trimmed at the bracket end. The bracket tab
  holes H1/H2 are 1.70 mm further from the bracket plate, so the card needs a bracket with longer tabs (see
  [Bracket](#bracket)).
* **No artwork on the back silkscreen**: the princess artwork is to be UV printed instead. The back texts stay.

The main board is through-hole apart from **U3, U4, U9** (TSSOP, 0.65 mm pitch), **U8** (APS6404L PSRAM, SOIC-8,
1.27 mm pitch) and the optional **U12** (USBLC6-2SC6, SOT-23-6), all on the front. The rest of the circuit is
v1.3.1's: USB-A host port, Waveblaster header, op-amp mixer.

> **Status: routed; not built or tested yet.** The placement of 2026-10-31 is routed on two layers (2026-11-01).
> The schematic's ERC is the same as v1.3.1's (280 warnings, 0 errors). DRC with schematic parity finds 0
> unconnected items and, as errors, only the 12 accepted courtyard overlaps in the logic column, so
> `hw-common/tools/jlcpcb.sh` exports with `FORCE=1`; `build/jlcpcb/` holds that export (not in git: the repository
> ignores `build/`). A first route was checked by an independent review and re-routed for its findings. Compared
> with the routed layout before it (DIP adapters, commit d5c4a85) it is better on I2S length, the DAC-to-mixer path
> and the vias at silkscreen text, and worse on the ISA data-bus length, the DAC output, summing-node and decoupling
> paths, which the new placement sets, and on the line-out ground error from a ground loop without a Waveblaster
> (still under the DAC's noise floor at 10 mA of loop current): see [Layout status](#layout-status).

The shared `PiGUS library` symbols and footprints are linked from `hw-common/`, like the other boards. **New in the
shared library for v1.3.2:** `TSSOP-16_4.4x5mm_P0.65mm_HandSolder_TestPads` (U3, U4),
`TSSOP-20_4.4x6.5mm_P0.65mm_HandSolder_TestPads` (U9) and `RPi_Pico_SMD_TH_USB_NoSWD` (U1, see
[102 mm board](#102-mm-board)), in `hw-common/PiGUS library.pretty`; DRC's library check finds the board's U1, U3,
U4 and U9 identical to them. The adapter footprints and adapter 3D models of the earlier v1.3.2 layout are removed;
the older `DIP-16_W7.62mm_TSSOP-16_Nested` stays unused.

Every part has a 3D model. The ones KiCad 10's library does not have are in `hw-common/parts`, reached through the
project folder's `parts` link: the CUI SJ1-3535NG jacks (J8 green; J5 a black copy of the same CUI model), the Alps
RK09712 pot (RV1) and a simple generated Bourns MF-R050 (F1). U3/U4/U9 use KiCad's TSSOP models, U1 KiCad's own
`RaspberryPi_Pico.step`, and J9's header model path is fixed. The library footprints carry the same models as the
board.

## What changed compared to v1.3.1

### U3/U4 and U9 with a test pad per pin

| | U3, U4 (SN74CB3T3257, TSSOP-16) | U9 (PCM5100A, TSSOP-20) |
|---|---|---|
| Footprint | `PiGUS library:TSSOP-16_4.4x5mm_P0.65mm_HandSolder_TestPads` | `PiGUS library:TSSOP-20_4.4x6.5mm_P0.65mm_HandSolder_TestPads` |
| Courtyard | 11.4 × 5.75 mm | 11.4 × 7.05 mm |
| Position (centre) | U3 (150.22, 110.10), U4 (161.44, 110.12), both 90° (pin 1 at the bottom left) | (168.99, 83.42), 180° (pin 1 at the bottom right) |

* **Land pattern**: the TSSOP hand-solder pads (1.775 × 0.40 mm at ±3.01 mm from the centre, toes out to ±3.9 mm),
  long enough to put an iron on each pin.
* **One test pad per pin**: a 0.7 mm round pad (bare copper, `testpoint` property) straight out from each pin,
  joined to it by a 0.2 mm track. The pads alternate between two columns, 4.45 and 5.10 mm from the centre, so each
  sits on its own pin's line and 1.3 mm from the next pad in its column; the track to an outer pad passes between two
  inner pads with 0.2 mm on each side, the board's normal clearance. The footprint has the pin numbers at the column
  ends in 0.8 mm silk. The pads make every pin reachable for a probe, a meter or a scope clip, and a solder bridge
  between two pins shows up as a short between their pads.
* **Routing**: an outer-column pin is routed from its test pad. An inner-column pin that is used gets a 0.2 mm
  escape stub straight on from its test pad, centred between the two outer pads, to 5.80 mm from the centre, and is
  routed from the stub end (26 stubs on the board). The router cannot squeeze a track between two outer pads (0.6 mm
  gap) any other way, and the stubs keep the 0.2 mm clearance exactly as the pin-to-pad tracks do.
* **Pin numbers stay the schematic's**: U9 is 1 CPVDD, 2 CAPP, 3 CPGND, 4 CAPM, 5 VNEG, 6 OUTL, 7 OUTR, 8 AVDD,
  9 AGND, 10 DEMP, 11 FLT, 12 SCK, 13 BCK, 14 DIN, 15 LRCK, 16 FMT, 17 XSMT, 18 LDOO, 19 DGND, 20 DVDD.
* The symbols' `Adapter` fields and the adapter wording in the descriptions and sheet notes are gone; the root sheet
  says "SMD: U3/U4 TSSOP-16, U9 TSSOP-20 (with test pads), U8 SOIC-8, U12 opt.".

![Test pads on U9 (and U3/U4): the TSSOP-20 land pattern to scale with its 20 test pads in two staggered columns
(inner 4.45 mm, outer 5.10 mm from the centre, 1.3 mm between two pads of a column), the 0.2 mm track from each pin
to its pad passing between two pads with 0.2 mm clearance on each side, and the escape stubs that carry an
inner-column pin out between two outer pads to the routing](docs/figures/test-pads.png)

### No GY-PCM5102 module option

J10 (the GY-PCM5102 module, soldered on male pins over the DAC area as the alternative to the on-board DAC since
v1.3.0) is gone from the schematic and the board. Its dashed silkscreen outline and the "DAC -OR- GY-PCM5102"
heading went with it; the heading now just says "DAC". Its nets (BCK, DIN, LRCK, +5V, GND, AUDIO_L/R) stay,
because U9's circuit uses them. U9, C12–C20, C36, FB3, R7 and R8 are always fitted. The BOM's J10 line and its
"DAC AREA: leave out ..." notes are gone.

### DAC decoupling

C36 (U9 CPVDD decoupling) is the board's standard 0.1 µF 50 V X7R radial disc (Murata RDER71H104K0M1H03A, the 0.1 µF
line of the BOM) instead of v1.3.1's 0603. The DAC's eight discs stand in two columns of three beside U9 and two
single positions, symmetric about U9: on the right, beside pins 1–10 (charge pump, VNEG, outputs, AVDD), C13 (AVDD),
C17 (VNEG), C16 (CAPP/CAPM) and C36 (CPVDD); on the left, beside pins 11–20 (I2S, LDOO, DVDD), C20 (output filter),
C14 (+3V3), C18 (LDOO) and C15 (AVDD, 10 µF); C12 (DVDD) below U9 and C19 (output filter) above it.

* **Each disc on its own pin's side.** In the first hand placement of this layout the discs were on the opposite
  side of U9 from their pins (CPVDD 10.5 mm, DVDD 10.7 mm from their discs). They were reassigned among the same
  slots, keeping the look; distances from the chip pin to the nearest pad of its disc, straight line:

  | Disc | Pins | Before the reassignment | Now | DIP-adapter layout (d5c4a85) |
  |---|---|---|---|---|
  | C36 | CPVDD (1) / CPGND (3) | 10.5 / 15.6 mm | 9.7 / 5.6 mm | 2.7 / 9.2 mm |
  | C16 | CAPP (2) / CAPM (4) | 10.0 / 4.8 mm | 9.5 / 4.6 mm | 3.2 / 3.2 mm |
  | C17 | VNEG (5) | 6.1 mm | 9.6 mm | 6.6 mm |
  | C13 | AVDD (8) / AGND (9) | 9.0 / 7.7 mm | 5.1 / 9.6 mm | 4.7 / 6.7 mm |
  | C18 | LDOO (18) / DGND (19) | 5.0 / 9.9 mm | 4.5 / 9.5 mm | 3.5 / 9.1 mm |
  | C12 | DVDD (20) / DGND (19) | 10.7 / 15.8 mm | 2.6 / 6.4 mm | 4.5 / 8.4 mm |

* **C36 and C16 face the other way** (pad 1 outward, chosen for the look): C36's CPVDD pad is 9.7 mm from pin 1
  where turning it would give 5.0 mm. C16 only joins CAPP and CAPM, so its direction does not matter.
* **C17 turned 180°** during routing (pad 1, VNEG, now the outer pad like C13/C16/C36): on U9's right edge the pins
  come out in the order OUTR (7), OUTL (6), VNEG (5); DAC_OUTL goes up to R7 above U9, and with C17's VNEG pad on
  the inside VNEG had to cross DAC_OUTL's way to reach it. Now VNEG runs on the front under C17's body to its outer
  pad, and DAC_OUTL drops to the back through a via next to its test pad (0.29 mm from C17's GND pad) and runs up
  under C17 and C13 to R7. VNEG's disc is 9.6 mm from pin 5 in a straight line (6.6 mm on the DIP-adapter layout);
  the run stays inside the DAC block, next to the analog pins only.
* C18 was 0.13 mm out of line with its mirror partner C16 in the uploaded placement, so its courtyard touched
  C15's; it is now in line with C16.

### C8/C10: through-hole discs next to U8

| Ref | Part | DigiKey | LCSC |
|---|---|---|---|
| C8 | 0.1 µF 50 V X7R radial disc, 5.0 mm pitch, Murata RDER71H104K0M1H03A (the BOM's 0.1 µF line) | 490-9144-1-ND | C527620 |
| C10 | 1 µF 50 V X7R radial disc, 5.0 mm pitch, Murata RDER71H105K2M1H03A | 490-9146-1-ND | C1620132 |

These are the v1.3.1 parts again (the routed layout of commit 8dbb6c6 had 0805s on the back under U8). U8 (SOIC-8,
front) stands at 90° at (190.00, 92.47): pins 1–4 along the bottom (y 94.95, pin 1 at the left), pins 5–8 along the
top (y 90.00), pin 8 (+3V3) at (188.09, 90.00), pins 3/4/7 GND. C8 (0.1 µF) stands vertically left of U8, its +3V3
pad 2.50 mm straight left of pin 8 at (185.59, 90.00) and its GND pad at (185.59, 95.00); C10 (1 µF) lies above U8,
+3V3 pad at (187.09, 87.00), GND pad at (192.09, 87.00). With them, every SMD part (U3, U4, U8, U9, U12) is on the
front.

### 102 mm board

The bracket end of the outline is trimmed 1.84 mm (x 220.13 → 218.29). The board is 101.90 × 99.85 mm at the
outline's line centres, 102.00 × 99.95 mm over its 0.1 mm lines (v1.3.1 and the routed v1.3.2 layout: 103.74 ×
99.85 / 103.84 × 99.95 mm). JLCPCB quoted USD 24.50 for 10 black ENIG 2-layer boards at 102.0 mm (and 101.9 mm), USD 33 at
102.7 mm and 33.53 at 103.74 mm (2026-10-28). The ISA fingers, the other three edges and the bracket plate's place in the case do not change.
To keep copper at least 0.35 mm from the new edge, these parts moved left, away from the bracket:

| Part | Moved | Now | Nearest copper to the new edge |
|---|---|---|---|
| H1 / H2 (bracket tab holes) | 1.70 mm | x 214.70 | 0.39 mm (their 6.4 mm pads) |
| J5 (MIDI out) | 1.10 mm | x 217.00 | 0.39 mm (sleeve pad) |
| J8 (line out) | 0.90 mm | x 217.00 | 0.39 mm (sleeve pad) |
| U1 (Pico), with its five test-pad rule areas and its two micro-USB relief slots | 1.35 mm | centre x 192.88, pin 1 (217.01, 100.00) | 0.36 mm (TP2/TP3); the slots (centre x 216.88) end 0.41 mm from the edge |
| U4 / U3 | – | TSSOP centres x 161.44 / 150.22 (re-placed for the soldered TSSOPs, see [Placement](#placement)) | – |

J11 and RV1 stay where they were. The distances are to the outline's line centre. Between these parts and the edge
there is no room for a track or a via: 0.3 mm copper-to-edge, a 0.2 mm track and 0.2 mm clearance need 0.7 mm. What
the trim means for the bracket is under [Bracket](#bracket): the tab holes need a bracket with 1.70 mm longer tabs.

![The bracket end trimmed from 103.74 to 101.90 mm: old (dashed) and new outline with the trimmed 1.84 mm strip, the
bracket plate and tabs from User.Drawings, the tab holes H1/H2 1.70 mm further in (7.03 mm from the plate instead of
5.33), J5, RV1, J8, J11 and the Pico's USB end with their moves and nearest copper to the new edge, and a table of the
x positions](docs/figures/bracket-trim.png)

* **U1 uses the new footprint `PiGUS library:RPi_Pico_SMD_TH_USB_NoSWD`**: `RPi_Pico_SMD_TH_USB` without the
  three SMD castellation pads at the SWD end (pads 41–43: SWCLK and SWDIO, both not connected, and GND; their
  through-holes stay) and with the courtyard 0.2 mm past the module there instead of 0.5 mm. With the old
  courtyard, U4's would overlap the Pico's by 0.25 mm.
* The Pico's USB end (x 218.38) is now flush with the edge: 0.09 mm past the outline's line centre (0.40 mm inside
  it before).
* The Pico's far end is at x 167.38, 2.9 mm under a full-size Waveblaster daughterboard's outline (x 170.32; routed
  v1.3.2 layout 1.6 mm, v1.3.1 1.3 mm). That matters for a socketed Pico (see [Socket build](#socket-build)).

### Placement

The board holds a hand arrangement on the 102 mm outline: the logic column and the Pico from 2026-10-28, and a new
DAC, mixer and jack arrangement for the soldered TSSOPs from 2026-10-31, routed afterwards (see
[Layout status](#layout-status)).

* **Logic column at the left edge** (as on the earlier v1.3.2 layout). U10, U7, U6 and U5 (DIP-14, 90°, pin 1 at the
  left as on v1.3.1) are stacked in line with U2 at x 120.07, 12.05 mm apart (pin 1 at y 65.62 / 77.67 / 89.71 /
  101.76; U2: 113.81). Each chip's decoupling cap lies horizontally (0°) in the gap above it, pad 1 2.21 mm straight
  above the supply pin (pin 14; U2: pin 20): C21 (U10, +5V), C6 (U7), C9 (U6), C7 (U5) and C4 (U2), pads at x
  120.07 / 125.07, y 55.79 / 67.83 / 79.88 / 91.93 / 103.97. R18, R5, R6 and R17 stand vertically (−90°) in one
  column at x 138.60, at the chips' right-hand ends (pad 1 at y 56.73 / 68.78 / 80.82 / 92.87). The column is
  packed tighter than the courtyards allow: 12 overlaps, accepted (see [Layout status](#layout-status)). The five
  references stand vertically at the board edge (x 117.50), centred on each chip.
* **U2** (DIP-20, 90°) at the lower left, pin 1 (120.07, 113.81). **J1** (the IRQ/DMA jumper block) at pin 1
  (136.03, 124.91), 90°, with its `IRQ`/`DMA` labels and numbers above it.
* **U3/U4** (TSSOP-16 with test pads, 90°): U3 (D0–D3, A0–A3) at (150.22, 110.10) and U4 (D4–D7, A4–A7) at
  (161.44, 110.12), pin 1 at the bottom left. Their decoupling discs C3/C5 lie above them at y 102.29 (C3's +3V3 pad
  at x 147.88, 4.8 mm from U3's pin 16), R2 at (160.97, 99.01).
* **DAC block, above the Pico**: U9 (TSSOP-20 with test pads) at (168.99, 83.42), 180°: pins 11–20 (I2S, LDOO,
  DGND, DVDD) on its left, pins 1–10 (charge pump, VNEG, outputs, AVDD, AGND) on its right. The decoupling discs
  stand in two columns beside it (see [DAC decoupling](#dac-decoupling)): C13, C17, C16, C36 at x 181.49 (y 79.42 /
  82.42 / 85.42 / 88.42), C14, C18, C15 at x 161.47 (y 82.42 / 85.42 / 88.42). The output filter is in two rows above U9,
  toward the mixer: C20 (161.47, 73.35), R8 (166.57, 76.35), R7 (171.28, 76.35), C19 (176.38, 73.35). C12 (DVDD) lies
  below U9 at (171.49, 88.92) and FB3 (the AVDD bead) along the bottom at (175.32, 92.35), facing the Pico's top row
  (y 100). The block is symmetric about U9's vertical centre line; `DAC` stands below it at (159.00, 91.00).
* **Mixer, above the DAC**: U11 (DIP-8, 90°) at (165.69, 65.31), C28/C29 (±12VA) above and below it at x 166.50,
  the feedback caps C30/C31 on its left at (157.69, 63.30 / 60.30), R23/R24 (±12V 10 Ω) at (174.27, 54.80) and
  (164.07, 68.31), C32/C33 (47 µF) at x 178.01 (y 57.30 / 63.30), C22/C23 at (182.50, 61.50 / 54.50), and the
  mixer resistors in two columns: R13, R11, R22, R10, R21 at x 189.43 (y 54.50 / 58.00 / 65.00 / 72.50 / 79.50) and
  R20, R12, R19 at x 199.58 (y 61.50 / 69.00 / 76.00). `MIXER` at (160.27, 57.80).
* **Bracket end, top to bottom: MIDI OUT, WT VOL, LINE OUT.** J5 (MIDI out) at (217.00, 49.00) with its parts
  R3 (176.64, 45.00), R4 (186.80, 49.00), FB1 (189.50, 45.00) and FB2 (189.50, 49.00) along the top; RV1 (WT VOL)
  at (214.00, 61.40); J8 (line out) at (217.00, 75.50). The labels
  `MIDI OUT`, `WT VOL` and `LINE OUT` are left-aligned at x 204.0 (y 43.5 / 65.0 / 70.0).
* **USB host corner**: U8 (SOIC-8) at (190.00, 92.47), 90°, with C8/C10 next to it (see
  [C8/C10](#c8c10-through-hole-discs-next-to-u8)); U12 at (197.14, 91.45), F1 vertical at (204.00, 90.00), C35 at
  (200.00, 95.00), C34 at (202.30, 83.50).
* **Waveblaster side**: R16 at (150.00, 46.00), 0°; C24, C25 and C26 in a row at y 45.50 (x 146.90 / 143.00 /
  139.00).
* **Pico (U1)** at (192.88, 108.89), pin 1 (217.01, 100.00), and the bracket end (H1/H2, J11) as on the earlier
  v1.3.2 layout (see [102 mm board](#102-mm-board)).

**Why this arrangement.** Four placements of the DAC, mixer and jacks were compared before routing, each with the
DAC discs on their pins and the logic-column labels as above: A (the first hand placement, DAC block high in the
middle), A2 (A with a DAC block turned 90°), C (that block in the middle with the mixer beside it) and D (this one).
In A2 and C, U9's I2S pins face away from the Pico, and a trial route of the three I2S nets alone (with the DAC
outputs kept clear) needed 232 and 238 mm; in A 171 mm; in D 122 mm. D also has the shortest DAC-to-mixer path
(AUDIO_L+R 51 mm of ratsnest against 61–87 mm) and the shortest ratsnest overall (4842 mm against 4910–4974 mm).
Its cost is distance to the digital side: the DAC block is 7.3 mm from the Pico and 5.1 mm from U8 (A: 20.2 /
19.0 mm), so the routing keeps digital nets out of the block (see [Routing](#routing)).

Positions are footprint origins (pin 1 for the DIPs, the centre for the TSSOPs), in mm. 51 of the 88 footprints moved
against the DIP-adapter layout; the logic column, U1, U2, the Waveblaster header and the bracket-end parts other
than J5/J8 did not.

### Silkscreen and back artwork

* Front `v1.3.2`, back `PicoGUS v1.3.2`.
* **Label font: Jost, embedded in the board file.** The 21 board labels (`WAVEBLASTER`, `MIXER`, `DAC`, `v1.3.2`,
  `LINE OUT`, `WT VOL`, `MIDI OUT`, `UART`, `USB PWR`, `IRQ`/`DMA` and their numbers, `< REAR`) use Jost Medium and
  Bold ([indestructible-type/Jost](https://github.com/indestructible-type/Jost), SIL Open Font License 1.1; the
  copyright and licence are in the font files' metadata), embedded with the board's embedded-fonts option. KiCad
  therefore shows and plots them the same on every machine, with or without the font installed. They were in
  Futura, inherited from v1.2, which was not embedded: each machine plotted its own substitute (DejaVu Sans or Inter
  in the cloud sessions that made the earlier gerbers). Futura cannot be embedded: Futura PT is marked
  "Preview & Print" only, so KiCad refuses it, and its licence forbids sharing the files. Jost is a free
  Futura-style face and looks almost the same at this size. Embedding adds about 120 KB to the board file. The
  v1.3.1 and v1.3.0 boards still use un-embedded Futura.
* **No princess artwork on the board.** It is removed from the back silkscreen and is to be UV printed on the back
  instead (source: `hw-common/art/mila-alisa.svg`; the routed v1.3.2 layout had it at 52.8 × 27.0 mm, v1.3.1 at
  71.6 × 37.0 mm). The back text block (version, copyright, licence, URL, thanks, dedication) and `< REAR` stay.
* **Front copper logo moved.** The exposed-copper PicoGUS logo (F.Mask openings over the front GND pour, with a rule
  area that keeps tracks and vias out) is turned horizontal and sits along the top edge above `LINE OUT`, x
  185.9–211.6, y 37.8–40.6, with `v1.3.2` right of it at (214.1, 40.0). Before, the logo stood vertically at the left
  edge (x 118.3–121.1, y 43.5–69.3) and `v1.3.2` at (120.5, 40.5). The pour under it is filled, so the logo shows
  copper.
* Labels placed by hand (2026-10-31). `MIXER` (160.27, 57.80) and `DAC` (159.00, 91.00) are centred, 1.2 mm high
  like the bracket-side labels (`DAC` was vertical at (186.3, 74.5) on v1.3.1). `WAVEBLASTER` is 1.2 mm (was 0.8),
  centred at (143.65, 37.5). `MIDI OUT`, `WT VOL` and `LINE OUT` are left-aligned at x 204.0 (y 43.5 / 65.0 / 70.0),
  `UART` and `USB PWR` at x 208.2 (y 121.5 / 126.0), so `UART` no longer touches J6's outline. The references of the
  logic column (U10, U7, U6, U5, U2) stand vertically at the board edge (x 117.50), centred on each chip; the
  references of the discs sit in the middle of each disc. The references of C22, C23, C32, C33, C34, U8, U12 and J11
  were placed by hand; U8's stands at (185.00, 88.00), nearer C10 than U8, and U12's is 0.08 mm from neighbouring silk.
  `< REAR` moved 1.70 mm left with H1/H2, its arrow tip still in line with them.
* **No via hole in any label**: the router counted every front and back silk text as a no-via area, so no via hole
  is within 0.10 mm of any text (the earlier routed layout had 13).
* v1.3.1's U12 pin-1 dot, left behind at (201.5, 89.7) next to F1 when U12 moved, is removed.
* Silkscreen DRC (with silk_over_copper/silk_overlap enabled): 45 silk_over_copper, all from the outlines of the
  decoupling discs in the logic column crossing the neighbouring DIP pads (`jlcpcb.sh` plots the silkscreen with the
  mask openings subtracted, so none of it prints on a pad); 2 silk_overlap (the IRQ/DMA divider line over J1 twice,
  as on v1.3.1); 19 silk_edge_clearance (J8, J5, RV1, J11 and the Pico's outline at
  the bracket end).

### Other

* Title blocks say v1.3.2 (root sheet and board 2026-10-28, the other sheets 2026-10-23). The schematic notes about
  the GY module and the SMD parts are updated, and `PicoGUS-THT-schematic.pdf` is plotted from the current schematic.
* No reference designator changed and none is new; J10 is the only one removed. The design rules and net classes
  are v1.3.1's (the `.kicad_pro` is unchanged).
* The schematic fields of C8/C10 name the Murata discs again (as on v1.3.1), and U1's footprint field is
  `PiGUS library:RPi_Pico_SMD_TH_USB_NoSWD`.
* 32 footprints (the wavetable sheet set, FB3, RV1, U11) still carried symbol links (KIID paths) from before the
  v1.3.0 schematic rebuild; DRC parity had only matched them by reference. They are re-linked to their symbols, so
  "Update PCB from schematic" keeps them.
* The U3/U4/U9 symbols point at the new TSSOP footprints with test pads; their `Adapter` fields are removed, and the
  sheet notes say "soldered to the card" (C36's note: "close to U9 pins 1 (CPVDD) and 3 (CPGND)").

## Layout status

The placement of 2026-10-31 is routed on two layers (2026-11-01). A first route of it was reviewed independently
from the analog/power and the digital/manufacturing side; this layout is the re-route that answers that review (see
[Review](#review)). The comparison is with the routed DIP-adapter layout of commit d5c4a85 (same netlist apart from
the U3/U4/U9 footprints), measured with the same scripts; that layout's README
(`git show d5c4a85:hw-tht-v1.3.2/README.md`) compares it with 8dbb6c6 and v1.3.1.

### Routing

* **Test-pad fan-out first**: the 52 pin-to-test-pad tracks and the 26 escape stubs (see
  [U3/U4 and U9 with a test pad per pin](#u3u4-and-u9-with-a-test-pad-per-pin)) are fixed copper; the router lands
  on the outer test pads and the stub ends. All 26 stubs carry a net.
* **Grid router** (negotiated-congestion rip-up and re-route, as for the earlier layouts), then polished, a GND pass
  (pours on both layers, stitching vias) and clean-up steps, each kept only if DRC stayed clean: redundant vias,
  GND finger tracks, stitching along the copper logo, thermal stubs, power widened up to 0.8 mm where it fits, vias
  moved off other-net pads, acute pad entries squared, power entries necked beside the gold fingers.
* **DAC block kept clear.** Digital, I2S and USB nets pay a cost within 1 mm of the audio copper, the DAC outputs and
  the DAC's analog nets (AVDD, VNEG, CAPP/CAPM, LDOO), and may not enter the analog half of the block (right of U9 and
  the output-filter rows above it). −12V, +5V and ~RI/OCHRDY may not enter the DAC block at all, +5V also not the
  mixer. **No track but GND runs on the front under U9**: AVDD crosses under the chip on the back (as the review
  suggested), I2S and ~RDACK go round it, so the front pour under the chip is one piece; 4 GND vias tie that pour
  and U9's ground pins to the back pour (3 under the body).
* **I2S may change layers** (via cost lowered): DIN and BCK leave U9 in the opposite order to the Pico's pins, so one
  of them has to cross the other.
* **Labels are no-via areas**: no via hole is within 0.10 mm of any silk text, front or back (the nearest is
  0.14 mm from C20's reference).
* Design rules unchanged (the `.kicad_pro` is v1.3.1's): 0.2 mm clearance, 0.3 mm copper to edge, 0.25 mm default
  track and 0.7/0.35 mm vias, `pwr` 0.4 mm and `GND` 0.5 mm with 0.8/0.4 mm vias, `audio` with 0.6 mm clearance.
  The 0.2 mm test-pad tracks and stubs, the centred 0.2 mm necks of +5V, +3V3 and ±12V between Pico and U2 pins and
  short jogs at pads are narrower than their class.
* 5587 mm of track and 450 vias: 214 GND, 29 power, 207 signal (784 plated holes with the THT pads).
* DRC with schematic parity: 0 unconnected items, and as errors only the 12 accepted courtyard overlaps below, so
  `jlcpcb.sh` needs `FORCE=1`. Warnings: 3 `lib_footprint_mismatch` (J3, J11, RV1; expected, see
  [Kept from v1.3.1](#kept-from-v131)), 19 `silk_edge_clearance`, 7 `starved_thermal` (J9's GND pins 7, 11, 15 and
  25 and the Pico's GND pins 8 and 33 have one spoke on the front, where signal tracks pass 0.22–0.36 mm away; on
  the back J9's four pins and pin 33 have two or three spokes into the main pour, pin 8 is joined by a 0.5 mm GND
  track; the Pico module also ties its GND pins together) and 83 schematic-parity field warnings (footprints without
  the symbols' Manufacturer/MPN fields, J3's BOM flag).

  ![The 7 starved thermal reliefs: J9 pins 7, 11, 15 and 25 and Pico pins 8 and 33 (pin 33 also on its castellation
  pad), each with one spoke on the front where 0.22-0.36 mm signal gaps leave no room for a second; on the back J9's
  pins and Pico pin 33 join the main pour with two or three spokes and Pico pin 8 by a 0.5 mm GND
  track](docs/figures/starved-thermals.png)

* **Courtyard overlaps (accepted), all in the logic column**: each decoupling disc's courtyard overlaps those of the
  DIPs above and below it by 0.33–0.34 mm (C21/U10, C6/U10, C6/U7, C9/U7, C9/U6, C7/U6, C7/U5, C4/U5, C4/U2), and
  the vertical resistors' overlap end to end by 0.20 mm (R18/R5, R5/R6, R6/R17). The disc bodies (F.Fab) stay about
  1.6 mm from the DIP bodies and 0.16 mm (seen from above) from the DIP pads; the discs' pads are 0.61 mm from the
  DIP pads. The resistors' pads are 0.29 mm apart end to end (GND/RESET, GND/+5V, DACK/+3V3): solder those with
  care.

  DIPs and of two resistors end to end](docs/figures/courtyard-overlaps.png)

### Review

The review of the first route (and the figure checks made with it) found, and this layout fixes:

* **U9's front ground was cut up.** AVDD, BCK, LRCK, DAC_OUTL and ~RDACK ran on the front under the chip, between its
  ground pins and the pour. Now nothing but GND runs on the front under U9 (AVDD on the back), and 4 GND vias (3
  under the body) join the front pour there to the back pour.
* **+5V ran through the mixer and the DAC block**, a second +5V path in parallel with the ground return under the
  analog parts. +5V is now kept out of both (0 mm² of +5V copper in the DAC block and mixer area).
* **−12V ran through the DAC block.** It is now kept out of it (0 mm²), with ~RI/OCHRDY.
* **Digital next to the DAC's analog nets** (an intermediate re-route had LRCK 0.23 mm from AVDD). No digital
  copper is now within 1.0 mm of the DAC's analog nets (AVDD, VNEG, CAPP/CAPM, LDOO) on the front; on the back, one ~RDACK via is
  0.60 mm from AVDD's track (0.35 mm of ~RDACK track within 1 mm of it). On the front no digital track or via is
  within 5 mm of U9 pins 1–10, and none within 1 mm of any audio net on either side.
* **Gold fingers**: +12V passed 0.29 mm from B10 (GND) and, after the re-route, −12V 0.24 mm from B8 (unused here, 0WS
  on AT boards); they are now 0.44 / 0.34 mm away. B10's 1.0 mm GND entry stuck out of the finger outline into the
  opening between the fingers; it is now 0.8 mm, 0.7 mm inside the finger, and no copper sticks out of any finger
  into the opening. No power copper is within 0.30 mm of an other-net
  finger (signal tracks pass the finger tops at 0.24 mm, as before).

  ![Solder side above J3's B-row fingers on 8dbb6c6 and on v1.3.2: an overview of B1-B31 and the no-fill strip,
  then close-ups of B5-B11 (±12V) and B28-B31 (+5V). Each finger is its own mask opening and only mask lies between
  a finger top (y 128.97) and the opening between the fingers (y 129.60). On v1.3.2 +12V is 0.44 mm from B10 and
  −12V 0.34 mm from B8; on 8dbb6c6 +5V passed 0.29 mm from B30](docs/figures/gold-fingers.png)

  B10's own GND track has no straight way up (+12V, −12V and IRQ2 cross above it): it runs 11.7 mm (0.8 mm, then
  0.5 mm, three layer changes) before it reaches a pour, where 8dbb6c6 had 1.0 mm all the way. B1 and B31, the
  other two ground fingers, run 1.0 mm straight into the pour.

  11.7 mm to the pour with three layer changes, 0.24 mm from B11 and 0.22 mm from +12V), B1 and B31 1.0 mm straight
  into the pour, and B10 on 8dbb6c6](docs/figures/b10-ground-finger.png)

Not changed, as the placement sets them (see [Known weaker points](#known-weaker-points-accepted)): the long mixer
summing nodes and DAC output runs.

### Compared with the DIP-adapter layout (d5c4a85)

| | d5c4a85 (DIP adapters) | v1.3.2 (soldered TSSOPs with test pads) |

| Via holes < 0.10 mm from silk text (inside the ink) | 7 (4) | 0 (0) |

Both columns come from the same scripts. The line-out rows come from the DC copper model described in d5c4a85's
README (refilled pours, 0.1 mm grid, the Pico's GND pins tied; `e = (Vref − Vsleeve) + 0.977·(Vref − V(U9.9)) + 2·(Vref − Vwt)`).
The figures below compare this layout with 8dbb6c6, the 103.7 mm layout that README compared against.

**Better** than d5c4a85: I2S length, the DAC-to-mixer runs (AUDIO_L/R), no via at any silk text, a solid front
ground under the DAC chip, USB D+. **Worse**, mostly set by the placement: the ISA data bus (U3/U4 moved for the
test pads), I2S vias, the DAC output runs and the mixer summing nodes (the output filter and the mixer inputs sit
further from U9 and U11), other-net copper beside audio copper, three vias nearer an other-net pad, B10's ground
track, and the line-out ground error without a Waveblaster (1019 against 285 µV/A for a loop to the fingers; with
a Waveblaster at full volume it is lower, 292 against 466).

### Known weaker points (accepted)

* **Mixer summing nodes**: U11's inverting inputs (U11.2 → R10/R12/R19/C30, U11.6 → R11/R13/R20/C31) are 51.3 and
  52.5 mm long (d5c4a85 14.6 / 36.1 mm): the mixer's input resistors sit at the DAC filter and the Waveblaster
  header, not at U11. They run on the front over the back pour (U11.6 with one via) and away from digital nets.
* **DAC outputs**: DAC_OUTL/R run 18.9 / 19.9 mm from U9 to R7/R8 above it (d5c4a85 3.3 / 3.0 mm). DAC_OUTL drops to
  the back next to its test pad and runs 1.3 mm under VNEG on the other layer before turning up under C17 and C13.
  U9's line drivers are low-impedance; the 470 Ω / 2.2 nF filter follows.
* **Audio beside other copper** (21.5 mm within 1 mm, same layer): U9's own VNEG, AVDD and CAPM tracks beside
  DAC_OUTL/R where they leave the neighbouring pins (11.8 mm, 0.20–0.92 mm), +5V beside WT_L along the Waveblaster
  header's corner (7.4 mm, 0.88 mm), and −12V at the top left (2.3 mm, 0.62 mm; d5c4a85 2.8 mm).
* **ISA data bus**: D0–D7 are 407 mm with 26 vias (d5c4a85 283 mm / 21; D3 86 mm with 6 vias), as U3/U4 moved to
  make room for their test pads. Irrelevant at ISA speed.
* **I2S**: 187 mm with 16 vias (d5c4a85 261 mm / 6): shorter, but the BCK/DIN crossing and the walk round U9 cost
  vias. None crosses an audio net; the nearest I2S copper is 5.0 mm from U9 pins 1–10.

  ![BCK, DIN and LRCK from the Pico to the DAC U9, both copper layers, with U9's analog pins 1-10, the
  CAPP/CAPM/VNEG/AVDD copper and the audio-class copper inside a 1 mm keep-away. v1.3.2: 187.5 mm and 16 vias,
  5.04 mm from U9 pins 1-10, only ~RDACK (0.60 mm, at AVDD) inside the keep-away. 8dbb6c6: 235.5 mm and 1 via; LRCK
  passes U9 pin 1 at 0.33 mm](docs/figures/i2s-around-dac.png)

* **Digital along the bottom of the DAC block**: ~RDACK, RESET, RUN, RA8, UART_TX and +12V cross the block's bottom
  strip (y 90–94), below U9's digital side and the supply parts (FB3, C15, C12); ~RDACK has two vias there, one
  0.60 mm from AVDD on the back. AD2 touches the block's left edge.
* **Vias near other-net pads**: three vias are 0.23–0.29 mm from an other-net pad (D2 at Pico pin 43, A6 at U2 pin
  14, DAC_OUTL at C17's GND pad); DRC's minimum is 0.20 mm and the clean-up step found no free spot within 0.6 mm.
* **U9's ground-strapped pins** (CPGND, AGND, DEMP, FLT, SCK, FMT, DGND) reach a GND via 1.4–3.6 mm away, through
  the front pour that now surrounds the chip.
* **Line-out ground loop**: per ampere of loop current from J8's sleeve to the fingers, the ground error at the
  jack is 1019 µV (right channel, no Waveblaster, RV1 turned down; d5c4a85 285 µV), and 466 µV to the bracket
  (d5c4a85 313 µV). With 10 mA of loop current that is 10.2 µV through the fingers and 4.7 µV through the bracket:
  below −100 dBV, under the DAC's noise floor (about 21 µV) and 100–300× less than the drop along the cable shield
  itself. With a Waveblaster at full volume it is lower than on d5c4a85 (292 against 466 µV/A). The bracket path
  only exists with a metal bracket screwed to the chassis; a 3D-printed bracket carries no loop current. 500 mA of
  USB-host load adds 269 µV at the worst channel (d5c4a85 128 µV).

  269 / 258 against 226 / 314 µV); and at 10 mA of loop current, 4.7-10.2 µV next to the DAC's 21 µV noise floor and
  1-3 mV across a cable shield](docs/figures/groundloop.png)

* **Silk**: no via hole touches any text. U8's reference stands nearer C10 than U8 and U12's is 0.08 mm from
  neighbouring silk (both placed by hand, left as placed).

  ![Via holes near silkscreen text: none is within 0.10 mm of any text on either side; the six nearest are 0.14 to

### Before ordering and building

* **Bracket**: get or print a bracket whose tabs are 1.70 mm longer than a Keystone 9202's (see [Bracket](#bracket)).
* In JLCPCB's placement preview, check pin 1 of U3, U4, U8, U9 and U12.
* **Solder the TSSOPs first** and check them on their test pads (see [Ordering](#ordering)).
* **Solder J11 before the Pico** and check the gap between its shield pad and Pico pin 4 (SPI_SCK, 0.80 mm) for a
  bridge (see [Kept from v1.3.1](#kept-from-v131)).

## Socket build

`BOM-THT-sockets.csv` (with `BOM-THT-sockets-digikey-upload.csv` and `-10x`) lists everything needed to build the
card with every DIP IC and the Pico socketed. The same parts are the optional socket lines of `BOM-THT.csv`. U3, U4
and U9 are soldered TSSOPs and U8/U12 SMD parts: they are never socketed.

| Socket for | Part (DigiKey) | Height above the board | Top of the part |
|---|---|---|---|
| U2 (DIP-20) | On Shore SA203000 (ED3020-ND) | 4.6 mm | ≤ 9.8 mm, **under the daughterboard** |
| U5, U6, U7, U10 (DIP-14 ×4) | Adam Tech ICM-314-1-GT-HT (2057-ICM-314-1-GT-HT-ND) | 4.6 mm | ≤ 9.8 mm, **under the daughterboard** |
| U11 (DIP-8) | On Shore SA083000 (ED3038-ND) | 4.6 mm | ≤ 9.8 mm, outside |
| U1 Pico | Adafruit 5585 short sockets (1528-5585-ND) + 5584 short plug headers (1528-5584-ND) | 5.0 mm | Pico board at ~7.5 mm |

* All are machined (round-pin) sockets with 0.5 mm tails that fit the 0.8 mm DIP holes. LCSC equivalents
  (CONNFLY DS1001-01) are in the CSV.
* **Daughterboard clearance**: a Waveblaster daughterboard sits ~11 mm above the card. U2, U5, U6, U7 and U10 are
  under it, and a socketed DIP reaches ~9.8 mm (about 1.2 mm worst-case margin, 2 mm typical). That is fine for a
  daughterboard with a flat underside; if yours has parts underneath, solder those ICs directly, or use the
  low-profile Mill-Max 115-43-3xx-41-003000 sockets (2.41 mm; they need 1.0 mm holes, so the DIP footprints would
  need a change).
* **A socketed Pico has no USB host port** (J11) unless three short wires connect its TP1–TP3 to the holes under
  it. The Adafruit short sockets keep the Pico at ~7.5 mm; the standard 8.5 mm Sullins sockets at ~11–12 mm. The
  Pico's far end (x 167.38) is 2.9 mm under a full-size daughterboard's outline (x 170.32), so with a daughterboard
  fitted use the short sockets.

## Kept from v1.3.1

* **RV1** stays in the middle of the bracket end (at the top, its M7 bushing would be 0.4 mm above the PC's slot
  opening); v1.3.2 puts J5 (MIDI out) above it and J8 (line out) below it. **J11 at x 208.64** (at x 210 its flange
  stood 1.26 mm into the bracket plate). **C32** (47 µF, 11 mm tall) stays out from under the daughterboard, now at
  (178.01, 57.30). C1's can is about 0.4 mm from a full-size daughterboard's maximum outline at nominal size,
  0.16 mm at maximum can size (v1.3.1: 0.68 / 0.43 mm; C1 moved 0.27 mm with the Pico row).
* No copper inside the gold-finger area: a no-fill rule area covers the strip above the fingers, and **J3's mask
  opening between the fingers starts 0.63 mm lower (y 129.6) than the finger tops**. Each finger also has its own
  mask opening, the size of the finger (from y 128.97, no mask expansion), so a track beside a finger top is
  covered only by the mask between them. Keep power copper at least 0.30 mm from the finger copper (this layout:
  0.31 mm, +5V next to B30 (OSC); ±12V 0.34 mm or more). The ISA GND fingers B1, B10 and B31 each have a back-side
  track into the pour, but only B1's is 1.0 mm all the way. B10's and B31's are 1.0 mm only inside the finger: B31's
  leaves it at 0.5 mm next to a +5V via and reaches the back pour 0.5 mm further on; B10's leaves it at 0.6 mm next
  to the +12V finger, runs 4.7 mm to a via in the no-fill strip and then about 5 mm at 0.5 mm on the front before it
  reaches the front pour (8dbb6c6: 1.0 mm tracks from all three).

  ![The GND tracks from the ground fingers B1, B10 and B31 to the pours. B10 on the solder side: 1.0 mm inside the
  finger, then 0.6 mm for 4.7 mm between IRQ2 (0.21 mm) and the +12V finger B9 (0.39 mm) to a via in the no-fill
  strip; on the component side 0.5 mm for 5.0 mm between D4 (0.22 mm), C1 pad 1 and D3 before it touches the front
  pour. A 1.0 mm track on the same path would leave 0.01 mm to IRQ2 and 0.00 mm to D4. B1 is 1.0 mm all the way, B31
  reaches its pour 0.5 mm after the finger; on 8dbb6c6 B10 had 1.0 mm on both layers](docs/figures/b10-ground-finger.png)

* **Don't run "Update footprint from library"** on J3 (the mask edit), J11 (the shield padstack below) or RV1 (the
  library footprint has a stray Edge.Cuts line that breaks the outline). DRC lists these three as
  `lib_footprint_mismatch` warnings; that is expected. J5, J8, RV1 and F1 also carry 3D models from `hw-common/parts`
  in place of stock model paths that KiCad 10's library does not have: updating them from the library puts the
  missing paths back. The two Pico micro-USB shell relief slots (1.3 × 2.0 mm) are
  drawn on Edge.Cuts as locked board items (JLCPCB wants non-plated slots on the outline layer), and five rule
  areas keep vias and the front pour away from the Pico's test pads. On v1.3.2 they moved with U1 (1.62 mm left in
  all: 0.27 mm, then 1.35 mm for the 102 mm trim); **move them with U1 again if U1 ever moves**.
* J11's shield pad next to the Pico's top pin row has a 2.6 mm pad on the front (3.0 mm on the back). With the Pico
  1.35 mm further in, it faces Pico pin 3 (GND): 0.48 mm on the front (2.08 mm to the pin's THT pad on the back), so
  a bridge there is harmless. Pin 4 (SPI_SCK), which faced it at 0.48 mm on v1.3.1 and the routed layout, is now
  0.80 mm away. **Solder J11 before the Pico and check the gap to pin 4 for a bridge.** H2's mask opening is 0.3 mm
  smaller (it sits 0.38 mm from Pico pin 39).
* Rule areas keep copper tracks out of the front exposed-copper logo, and vias and the front GND pour out from under
  the flat Pico's test pads (TP4–TP6, Pico 2 TP7) and its TP1–TP3 USB area.
* U12's GND (pin 2) has a GND via 1.30 mm from the pin (the DIP-adapter layout: 1.26 mm); keep one there.
* A `JLCJLCJLCJLC` order-number placeholder sits on B.Fab next to the Pico (not plotted). No via hole touches its
  box (the nearest, a RESET via, is 0.48 mm below it). If an order ever uses "Specify a location", check the box for
  via holes again after any routing change.

## Unchanged from v1.3.1

### USB host port (J11, sheet 4 "USB host port")

A USB-A host port at the bracket for a mouse, joystick, keyboard, flash drive (CD-ROM images) or a hub, as on the
PicoGUS NE2000 card and the PicoMEM 2.

* **Data**: straight from the Pico's own USB D+/D− test points **TP3 / TP2** (behind the Pico's 27 Ω series
  resistors). U1 uses `RPi_Pico_SMD_TH_USB_NoSWD`: the v1.3.0 Pico footprint plus three plated holes under TP1
  (GND), TP2 (D−) and TP3 (D+), without the SMD pads at the SWD end (v1.3.1: `RPi_Pico_SMD_TH_USB`, with them). The
  Pico must be **soldered flat** (castellated edge or through-hole pins, no header) so
  the three pads can be soldered from the back of the card. The positions are the same on Pico, Pico 2, Pico W and
  Pico 2 W. On headers or in a socket, solder three short wires (26–30 AWG, under 3 cm) from TP1–TP3 into the holes,
  or use the micro-USB OTG route of v1.3.0. The Pico's micro-USB stays in parallel with J11: **use one or the other.**
  TP2 = D− and TP3 = D+ were checked against Raspberry Pi's Pico R3 schematic and KiCad's own Pico footprint.
* **J11**: Molex 67643 (0676430910, DigiKey WM4993-ND / LCSC C2798029), stock footprint
  `Connector_USB:USB_A_Molex_67643_Horizontal`. Its front lip (14.4 × 7.16 mm, the frontmost part, 12.99 mm in
  front of the pin row) sits 0.1 mm behind the inside of the bracket plate. It is larger than the 13.6 × 6.2 mm
  cut-out, so it is the panel stop: nothing of J11 enters the cut-out, only the USB plug comes in through it. The
  receptacle face is 0.9 mm behind the outside of the bracket (PicoGUS 2.0: 1.3 mm), see [Bracket](#bracket).
* **VBUS**: ISA +5 V through **F1** (Bourns MF-R050, 0.5 A hold) with C34 (220 µF low-impedance; USB 2.0 asks for
  ≥ 120 µF) and C35 (0.1 µF), always on, like the PicoMEM 2's USB-A port. The Pico's VBUS pin (J7) is not involved.
* **U12** (USBLC6-2SC6, SOT-23-6): optional ESD protection on D+/D−, routed flow-through as on v1.3.1: D+ J11 →
  pin 6 → under the body → pin 1, D− pin 4 → pin 3, on to the Pico, so there are no stubs and the port works without
  U12. On v1.3.2 it sits next to U8, about 10 mm west of J11's pins (F1 between), with C35 (0.1 µF) just below it.
  Pin 1 is marked by the footprint's silk triangle just above it (v1.3.1's hand-placed dot is removed). **If you fit
  U12, solder it before C35**, 0.36 mm below it.
* USB-C was considered and left out: the PicoMEM 2 also uses USB-A for its host port and USB-C only for
  programming (5.1k Rd, never sourcing VBUS). A dual USB-A/USB-C footprint is in the shared library, unused.

### Waveblaster header without standoff holes

J9 uses `PiGUS library:Wavetable_NoMountingHoles`: the v1.3.0 `Wavetable` footprint without the two 3.2 mm
daughterboard standoff holes (the far one landed in U4 in the rev B placement). The daughterboard is held by the
2x13 header only, so there is no M3 standoff and no screws in the BOM. A full-size daughterboard overhangs the
card's far end; support it by hand when plugging/unplugging cables.

### Bracket

The bracket parts are where v1.3.1 had them, not where v1.3.0 (and v1.2) had them. **The tab holes H1/H2 are
1.70 mm further from the plate than on a Keystone 9202**: their centres are 7.03 mm behind the plate's inner face
instead of 5.33 mm (measured on the board's bracket drawing on User.Drawings), because the card is 1.84 mm shorter
at the bracket end (see [102 mm board](#102-mm-board)). A stock Keystone 9202, a PicoGUS 2.0 bracket and the brackets
for v1.2, v1.3.0, v1.3.1 and the routed v1.3.2 layout therefore do not fit: the card needs a bracket with tabs
1.70 mm longer, e.g. a 3D-printed one (the bracket drawing on User.Drawings has them). The plate itself sits where
it always does in the case, so the openings do not change. Hole positions (distances measured down from the
bracket's top surface, height = centre above the card's component side):

| Part | Hole | Down from the bracket top | Height |
|---|---|---|---|
| J5 MIDI out | Ø6.3–6.5 mm | 14.9 mm | 7.0 mm |
| RV1 WT volume (M7 bushing) | Ø7.2–7.5 mm | 23.9 mm | 6.5 mm |
| J8 line out | Ø6.3–6.5 mm | 41.4 mm | 7.0 mm |
| J11 USB-A | 13.6 × 6.2 mm rectangle, corners R ≤ 0.5 | 54.0 mm (centre; the cut-out runs from 47.2 to 60.8 mm) | 1.0–7.2 mm (centre 4.1) |

* All four are inside the PC/AT slot opening (it starts 10.95 mm below the bracket top). A jack is on top because its
  Ø6 nose fits there; RV1's M7 nut needs the room further down. MIDI OUT (J5) is on top and LINE OUT (J8) below
  RV1 (the DIP-adapter layout had them the other way round).
* No hole for the Pico's micro-USB: its plug can't enter the slot opening. Flash the Pico before soldering it,
  or with `pgusinit`.
* The webs between the holes are about 2.1 mm (J5–RV1), 10.6 mm (RV1–J8) and 2.5 mm (J8–J11).
* J11's x position was checked against the PicoGUS 2.0, whose USB-A port is proven in production. Its bracket is a
  Keystone 9202 derivative with 1.0 mm longer tabs (its tab holes sit 0.94 mm closer to the edge connector), so
  both brackets' plates end up within 0.06 mm of each other in a case. The 2.0's USB-A face is 1.31 mm behind the
  outside of its plate; J11's is 0.89 mm behind a Keystone 9202's, so J11 (x 208.64) is right. Moving it out would
  put its front lip into the plate. A PicoGUS 2.0 bracket does not fit this card: its cut-outs are elsewhere, and
  its tab holes are 0.94 mm, not 1.70 mm, further in.
* **J5 and J8 moved in** with the trim (1.10 / 0.90 mm), so their noses now end 0.32 / 0.31 mm behind the plate's outer
  face (on the bracket drawing's 0.78 mm plate, x 221.73–222.51; v1.3.1: 0.79 / 0.58 mm past it). A
  plug whose body is wider than the hole then stops on the plate about 0.3 mm short of the jack. A counterbore of
  about 0.4–0.5 mm around those two holes on the outside of the plate lets it seat fully; on a thicker (3D-printed)
  plate the noses end further behind its outer face, so size the counterbore for that plate.
* J5 and RV1 are 9.0 mm apart (v1.3.0: 9.7 mm between J5 and RV1): with a Ø8 mm plug in J5, use a knob of
  Ø9.5 mm or less on RV1.

## What changed in v1.3.0 compared to v1.2

### Through-hole parts

| Part | v1.2 | THT board |
|---|---|---|
| Resistors | 0805 | 1/4 W axial, 10.16 mm hole pitch |
| Ceramic caps | 0805 / 1206 | radial MLCC / disc, **5.0 mm** lead pitch |
| Electrolytics | 1206 / SMD | 5 mm radial electrolytics |
| D1 | B5819W SOD-123 | 1N5819 DO-41 |
| U2 | 74LVC244 TSSOP-20 | **74AHC244 DIP-20** |
| U5 | 74AHC14 SOIC-14 | **74AHC14 DIP-14** |
| U6 | 74LVC00 SOIC-14 | **74AHC00 DIP-14** |
| U7 | 74LVC1G00 SOT-23-5 | **one gate of a 74AHC00 DIP-14**, 3 spare gates tied off |
| U10 | 74LVC2G06 SOT-23-6 (open drain, 3V3) | **74AHCT126 DIP-14 at +5 V**, used as a "pseudo open-drain" |
| FB1/FB2 | 0805 beads | axial ferrite beads (bead on leads), 12.7 mm hole pitch |

Only the parts that exist in SMD packages alone are not plain through-hole parts:

* **U3, U4** SN74CB3T3257: FET bus-switch mux with 5 V→3.3 V clamping. It only comes in TSSOP-16/TVSOP. No DIP
  part does this job without redesigning the ISA bus interface (and the PIO timing). **v1.3.2: soldered to the
  card, with a test pad per pin** (v1.3.0/v1.3.1: soldered to the card, no test pads).
* **U9** PCM5100A/PCM5101A/PCM5102A DAC: TSSOP-20. **v1.3.2: soldered to the card, with a test pad per pin.**
* **U8** APS6404L PSRAM: SOIC-8 (1.27 mm pitch), soldered to the card.
* **U12** (rev B, optional) USBLC6-2SC6 ESD array: SOT-23-6, 0.95 mm pitch.

All of them can be hand-soldered. (Rev B also had C36 as an 0603; v1.3.2 makes it a THT disc.)

The 3.3 V logic needs 5 V-tolerant inputs, so it is 74**AHC** in DIP (TI still makes these and DigiKey
stocks them). **LCSC has almost none of these DIPs in stock** (0–74 pcs on 2026-09-28): order the logic
ICs from DigiKey.

### U10: 74AHCT126 instead of 74LVC2G06

The open-drain 74LVC2G06 has no DIP equivalent that takes a 3.3 V input and has a 5 V
open-drain output. HC/LS open-drain parts either need 5 V input levels or float "high"
while the Pico boots, which would hang the ISA bus through IOCHRDY. The AHCT126 runs from +5 V and
accepts the 3.3 V signals (TTL thresholds). It is wired as a pseudo open-drain driver:
input **A is tied to GND**, and the signal that drove the old inverter input now drives **OE**. OE=1 pulls the line low;
OE=0 releases it. The polarity is the same as on v1.2, so **no firmware change** is needed.

* Gate A: IOCHRDY (as v1.2). **R18** (100 k pull-down on `~RI/OCHRDY`) keeps IOCHRDY released
  while +5 V is up but the Pico's 3.3 V rail isn't yet, or while the Pico is in reset.
* Gate B: MIDI-out current loop (as v1.2).
* Gate C: Waveblaster `/RESET`. Gate D: Waveblaster MIDI (see below).
* **Only use 74AHCT126 here** (SN74AHCT126N). A 74**HCT**126 has
  input clamp diodes to VCC: with the Pico powered from USB and the PC off, the Pico's
  outputs would back-power the ISA +5 V rail through it. A 74**HC**126 at 5 V doesn't recognise 3.3 V
  highs. An **AHC**126 would work electrically, but its 5 V thresholds leave no margin.

**R17** (10 k pull-up on `UART_TX`) holds the MIDI and Waveblaster MIDI lines idle while the Pico boots
(the RP2040 pads default to pull-down, which would otherwise send a MIDI "break").

### Waveblaster header (new)

`J9` is the standard 26-pin Waveblaster header (2x13 male, 2.54 mm; the daughterboard has the
female socket). The pinout is as on PicoGUS 2.0: DGND 1,3,5,7,9,11 · AGND 15–25 odd · +5 V 6,10,14 ·
+12 V 18 · −12 V 22 · MIDI to DB 4 · audio R 20 · audio L 24 · /RESET 26 · 2,8,12,13,16 n.c.

* **MIDI** (pin 4): the MPU-401 UART (`UART_TX`, the same data as the MIDI-out jack) through U10D,
  a pseudo open-drain driver with a **10 k pull-up to +3.3 V** (R16). The line swings 0/3.3 V: that is
  a valid TTL high for 5 V daughterboards, and it is safe for modern 3.3 V daughterboards
  (Dreamblaster etc.) that are not 5 V tolerant.
* **/RESET** (pin 26): ISA RESET through U10C, also pseudo open-drain with a 10 k pull-up to +3.3 V (R9).
* **±12 V** come straight from the ISA bus. They are now connected on this board, with 0.1 µF decoupling at J9.
* v1.3.0: the footprint includes the standard support hole at the far end of the daughterboard (M3 × 11 mm
  standoff). **Rev B and v1.3.2 have no standoff holes** (see above).

* The two sources are summed by a **NE5532 inverting summer** (U11, DIP-8, powered from ISA ±12 V).
  **PCM has (almost) unity gain** (R19/(R7+R10) = 20k/20.47k, −0.2 dB), so the PCM line out has the same
  level as on v1.2 (2.1 Vrms full scale). **The WT input has a gain of 2 (+6 dB) at RV1 max** (R19/R12 = 20k/10k):
  Waveblaster daughterboards put out only about 1–1.2 Vrms full scale (a DreamBlaster X2 uses an AKM AK4388
  DAC, 1.13 Vrms), so at unity gain MIDI ended up 5–6 dB quieter than PCM. RV1 trims it down. C30/C31
  (47 pF) put the feedback corner at ~170 kHz (10k ∥ 100 pF was ~160 kHz). The output is phase-inverted, which you can't hear.
* **Changed 2026-10-09** (BOM only, no board change): R10, R11, R19, R20 were 10k and C30/C31 were 100 pF
  (about unity gain for both sources; PCM was −0.4 dB). On a board built that way, swap R10/R11/R19/R20 to
  20k (and C30/C31 to 47 pF; leaving 100 pF costs only ~0.2 dB more at 20 kHz) to get the extra WT gain. Raising the feedback instead
  of lowering R12/R13 keeps the daughterboard's load as before: about 4.8 kΩ at RV1 max (RV1 ∥ R12 ∥ R14).
* **RV1** (dual-gang 10 k audio taper, right angle: Bourns PTD902-2020K-A103, or the Alps RK097 the footprint was drawn for) sets the Waveblaster
  level. Its shaft goes through the ISA bracket between the MIDI and line-out jacks. The signal is on the
  CW-end terminals (3/6) and GND is on the CCW end (1/4), so the level rises clockwise. The 10 k summing
  resistor loads the wiper only a little, because a log pot's wiper is near the GND end for most of its travel.
* C22/C23 (10 µF **bipolar** electrolytics, Panasonic SU) block any DC offset from the daughterboard.
  The DC across them depends on the daughterboard (some outputs are AC-coupled, some carry an offset), so a
  polarised cap could end up reverse-biased; a bipolar one doesn't care. R14/R15 (100 k) give the
  capacitors a defined DC level when no daughterboard is fitted. Without a daughterboard, RV1's setting doesn't matter.
* The PCM510x sees a ~20.5 kΩ load (R7 + R10; its datasheet minimum is 1 kΩ). The output is DC-coupled, which is fine because the
  DAC's outputs are ground-centred; expect a few mV of offset at the jack.
* R21/R22 (100 Ω) isolate the op-amp from cable capacitance. The NE5532 drives 600 Ω headphones
  easily, but this is still a line output.
* **Op-amp supply filter.** The ISA ±12 V rails carry PSU ripple and noise from other cards. They reach U11
  through R23/R24 (10 Ω) and C32/C33 (47 µF), an RC low-pass at about 340 Hz, with C28/C29 (0.1 µF) at the
  op-amp pins. The NE5532's supply rejection falls at high frequencies, which is where this filter works.
  The daughterboard still gets the plain ±12 V (decoupled at J9); it has its own regulators and filtering.
* **DAC analogue supply.** On v1.2 the PCM510x AVDD (pin 8) shares the Pico's switch-mode 3.3 V with all the logic.
  Here AVDD has its own rail behind ferrite bead FB3 (the same part as FB1/FB2), with C13 (0.1 µF) and C15 (10 µF) at
  the pin. DVDD and CPVDD stay on the plain 3.3 V, as on v1.2/v1.3.0. Since rev B the charge-pump supply CPVDD (pin 1)
  has its own 0.1 µF, C36, so its current loop pin 1 → C36 → pin 3 (CPGND) is short: 1.9 + 0.6 mm on rev B; on v1.3.2,
  a THT disc in the right-hand column of the DAC block (its +3V3 pad 9.7 mm from pin 1 and its GND pad 5.6 mm from
  pin 3 in a straight line; see [DAC decoupling](#dac-decoupling)) (before rev B it was
  about 24 mm of track to C4 and back through the pour). TI's layout guide and PicoGUS 2.0 put this cap right at the
  pin. CPVDD stays on +3V3, as on v1.2/v1.3.0, and TI's 10 µF bulk cap at CPVDD is not fitted locally (the nearest
  bulk is C1). The bead drops only millivolts at the DAC's ~10 mA.
* **Capacitor types in the signal path:** C19/C20 (DAC output filter) and C30/C31 (op-amp feedback) are
  **C0G/NP0**, which has no voltage or temperature coefficient and so adds no distortion. X7R is used only for
  supply decoupling.

v1.3.0 and v1.3.1 also had a footprint for a GY-PCM5102 DAC module (J10) as an alternative to the on-board DAC;
**v1.3.2 has no module option** (see above).

### Back silkscreen

The back carries the princess artwork (hw-common/art/mila-alisa.svg: a big and a small princess, both crowned, with
sparkles and a castle, over the PicoGUS logo): on rev B 71.6 × 37.0 mm, its lower edge 3 mm above the Pico's pin
holes, 6 mm off the card's centre toward the bracket. The back is full of through-hole pads, so the artwork is cut
out 0.3 mm around every pad and hole (silkscreen never lands on copper). **v1.3.2 has no artwork on the board**: it
is to be UV printed on the back instead (the routed v1.3.2 layout, commit 8dbb6c6, had it re-placed at 52.8 ×
27.0 mm; see [Silkscreen and back artwork](#silkscreen-and-back-artwork)).

The version and licence block sits between the Pico's pin rows, one text per line, ending with the thanks and the
dedication: *Thanks to polpo and all the PicoGUS contributors. This revision is dedicated to my wonderful family, Mila
and Alisa.* On v1.3.1 each line was nudged (at most 0.9 mm) so that no via hole lands in a letter; on the routed
v1.3.2 layout the lines were re-spaced so that no via hole was within 0.10 mm of a letter. This board keeps those
positions, and its via holes are at least 0.14 mm from every letter of the text block and 0.13 mm from `< REAR`.
"< REAR" points at the bracket, its arrow tip in line
with the bracket tab holes H1/H2. All are mirrored on B.SilkS so they read correctly from the back.

### Other changes

* The board is **103.7 × 99.9 mm** (v1.3.2: 101.9 mm long, see [102 mm board](#102-mm-board)). It has the same length, ISA edge connector and bracket tab holes (H1/H2) as
  v1.2 (on v1.3.0 the MIDI and line-out jacks are also in the v1.2 places; rev B and v1.3.2 move them, see
  [Bracket](#bracket); v1.3.2 is also 1.84 mm shorter, with H1/H2 1.70 mm further in, see
  [102 mm board](#102-mm-board)), but it is taller, like PicoGUS 2.0, to fit the Waveblaster header along the top edge.
  1.6 mm FR4 (the v1.2 and v1.3.0 board files' stackup says 0.57 mm; rev B's and v1.3.2's say 1.6 mm, so their 3D
  and STEP exports have the right thickness).
* Design rules are relaxed for THT/DIY: 0.2 mm clearance, 0.25 mm signal / 0.4 mm power tracks
  (+5 V, +3.3 V, VSYS), 0.7/0.35 mm vias (rev B and v1.3.2: the same, plus a 0.6 mm-clearance `audio` class).
  GND is poured on both layers (v1.3.2 too, with stitching vias; see [Layout status](#layout-status)).
* **J2 (the 2x31 ISA debug/probe header of v1.2, never fitted) is removed.** On a through-hole board
  its pads formed a wall right above the gold fingers that every ISA signal had to cross.
* The `+3.3V` power symbols are renamed `+3V3`. KiCad 8+ names power nets after the symbol value, so the
  upgraded v1.2 sheets would otherwise have split the 3.3 V rail into two nets.
* The symbol fields of U3/U4 now name the CB3T3257 that is actually used (the v1.2 fields still said 74FST3257DR2G).
* **Layout is grouped by circuit block.** Each chip and its decoupling caps and resistors form a KiCad group,
  so a block can be selected and moved as one: DAC (U9), Mixer + line out (U11, J8), WT volume (RV1),
  Waveblaster header (J9), MIDI out (J5), Pico + power (U1), ISA bus switches (U3, U4), ISA buffer (U2),
  74AHC14 (U5), 74AHC00 (U6, U7), 74AHCT126 (U10), PSRAM (U8, C8, C10), IRQ/DMA jumpers (J1).
  On v1.3.2, U2, U6 and U7 (with C4, C6, C9) are not grouped.
* **Layout for audio quality:** every decoupling cap sits next to its chip's supply pin. FB3 sits next to C13/C15.
  The ±12 V filter (R23/R24, C32/C33) sits above U11. The DAC is turned so that its outputs, the output RC filter
  (R7/R8, C19/C20) and the mixer op-amp form one short path to the line-out jack, away from the Pico and the ISA
  logic (v1.3.2: U9 at 180° above the Pico, its pins 1–10 on the right and the output filter in two rows above it,
  toward the mixer).

## Card dimensions (ISA 8-bit)

The card is **101.9 mm long × 99.85 mm tall** (bottom of the fingers to the top edge, at the outline's line
centres; 102.0 × 99.95 mm over its 0.1 mm lines). v1.3.1 and the routed v1.3.2 layout were 103.7 mm long: v1.3.2 is
trimmed 1.84 mm at the bracket end (see [102 mm board](#102-mm-board)). The IBM PC/XT full-height limit is 4.2 in
(106.7 mm), so the card is 6.8 mm under it; the AT limit is 4.8 in (121.9 mm). The edge connector (62 contacts,
0.1 in pitch) and its position are unchanged from v1.2; the bracket tab holes H1/H2 are 1.70 mm further in than on
v1.2 (see [Bracket](#bracket)). The board is 1.6 mm, the standard ISA card thickness. A Waveblaster daughterboard
sits about 11 mm above the card, inside the 0.8 in (20.3 mm) AT slot pitch. Clip the THT leads short (≤ 2 mm) on the
solder side, where the next card sits. There are no SMD parts on the back.

The **SMD** version of this board is in [`hw-smd/`](../hw-smd/README.md).

## Ordering

`BOM-THT.csv` lists, for every line, the DigiKey part (with DigiKey stock) and the LCSC part (with LCSC stock),
plus alternatives: v1.3.0 lines as of 2026-09-28, rev B lines 2026-10-18, v1.3.2 lines 2026-10-23. DigiKey numbers
were checked against findchips distributor data or DigiKey itself, and LCSC numbers against the LCSC product API.

* **Logic ICs (U2, U5, U6, U7, U10): order from DigiKey.** LCSC lists the DIPs, but has 0–74 in stock.
* **SMD parts on the card**: U3, U4 (TSSOP-16), U9 (TSSOP-20), U8 (SOIC-8) and the optional U12 (SOT-23-6), all on
  the front. Solder them before the through-hole parts, the TSSOPs first; then check each pin against its neighbours
  on the test pads (a bridge shows as a short between two pads) and ring each test pad through to the part it
  connects to.
* **DigiKey BOM cost**: the v1.3.0/v1.3.1 estimate (2026-09-28, parts only, no PCB, no shipping, from DigiKey's price
  breaks) was ~474 kr excl. MVA (~$50) for one board and ~356 kr (~$37) per board in a 10-board order (NOK at 9.53
  NOK/USD; digikey.no can differ by a few percent). The TSSOPs are the same chips as on v1.3.1; C8/C10 are the
  v1.3.1 discs again, and the disc C36 (an 0603 on v1.3.1) changes the total by less than 10 kr. The optional
  machined socket set was ~80 kr on rev B, plus ~21 kr for the Pico sockets.
* **Ceramic capacitors must have 5.0 mm (or 5.08 mm) lead pitch.** 2.5 mm parts don't fit (e.g. TDK FG1x, Vishay K…L2).

Mistakes found in the v1.2 BOM/JLCPCB data (don't copy these from the v1.2 files):
C139966 is a Vilsion part, not the APS6404L. C2910528 is a 3.5 mm jack with a different pinout.
C2905423 is a female header, not the Pico. C2935925 is DEALON, not Amphenol. C6942 is the SOIC SN74AHC14DR.

## JLCPCB files

```
FORCE=1 hw-common/tools/jlcpcb.sh hw-tht-v1.3.2/PicoGUS-THT.kicad_pcb   # -> hw-tht-v1.3.2/build/jlcpcb/
```

The script stops if DRC (including the schematic-parity check) finds errors. On this board DRC finds only the 12
accepted courtyard overlaps (see [Layout status](#layout-status)), which are errors in this project's rules, so
export with `FORCE=1` after checking that the report lists nothing else. `build/jlcpcb/` holds the export of the
routed board made that way (2026-11-01; not in git: the repository ignores `build/` and `*.zip`, so a clone has to
run the script): outline to x 218.29 (102.0 mm), 450 vias, 784 plated holes. It writes:

* `PicoGUS-THT-gerbers.zip`: upload this to jlcpcb.com. It holds the Gerbers (Protel extensions, no X2)
  and the Excellon drill files (PTH and NPTH separate, mm).
* `PicoGUS-THT-bom-jlc.csv` and `PicoGUS-THT-cpl-jlc.csv`: the BOM and placement files for JLCPCB assembly. The
  placement file has the SMD parts only, all on Top: **U3 and U4 (90°), U8 (90°), U9 (180°) and U12 (0°)**.
  The rotations are KiCad's, with no JLCPCB offset table; a correction worked out for v1.3.1's U8 (−90°) does not
  carry over. The TSSOPs' test pads are part of their footprints, so JLCPCB can place U3/U4/U9 too.
* `PicoGUS-THT-drc.rpt`: the DRC report.

The **Hardware (JLCPCB files)** GitHub Action runs the same script for `hw-tht` (v1.3.0) and `hw-smd`. v1.3.1 and
v1.3.2 are not in it.

Order options: 2 layers, **1.6 mm**, **Surface finish: ENIG** and **Gold fingers: Yes** with the **45° finger
chamfer** (the ISA edge connector). ENIG is required: JLCPCB only gold-plates the fingers on ENIG boards; with HASL
the fingers are tinned, and tin wears and oxidises in an ISA slot. The fingers start 0.58–0.60 mm above the card
edge, as on v1.2, so JLCPCB's bevel (about 0.74 mm) takes about 0.15 mm off their tips. Check the rotations in
JLCPCB's placement preview before paying for assembly (pin 1 of U3, U4, U8, U9 and U12). JLCPCB no
longer prints an order number by default.
The `JLCJLCJLCJLC` placeholder sits on B.Fab next to the Pico (not plotted): if an order ever needs "Specify a
location", move it to B.Silkscreen first, or JLCPCB prints the placeholder text itself.

## Caveats

1. **Not built or tested.** v1.3.2 is routed and reviewed (see [Layout status](#layout-status)). The circuit is the
   proven v1.2 one with the v1.3.x additions, but no v1.3.x THT board has been fabricated or run in a PC yet.
2. **Audio needs −12 V.** The mixer op-amp runs from ISA ±12 V, so without −12 V there is
   **no line output at all** (not even PCM). Every AT/ATX PC power supply provides −12 V. Some unusual
   backplanes or small DC-DC "pico" supplies may not, so check yours.
3. **Slower logic in the ISA path.** 74AHC00 (U6/U7) is a few ns slower than the v1.2 74LVC00,
   and IOCHRDY now goes through an AHCT126 instead of an LVC2G06. At ISA speeds this should be
   harmless, but it hasn't been tested on fast (10–12 MHz) buses.
4. **AHC input thresholds.** At 3.3 V, 74AHC needs ~2.3 V for a logic high (74LVC: 2.0 V). The ISA
   signals that reach U5/U7 directly (AEN, RESET, DACK) are fine from any normal chipset or
   74LS/F/ACT driver (VOH ≈ 3.4 V or more). A marginal old bus that only gives the TTL minimum of 2.4 V
   has little margin.
5. **Daughterboard clearance.** The Waveblaster daughterboard sits ~11 mm above the card, and a
   full-size (Creative-spec) board covers most of the card's left half. Only low parts are placed under it (DIP ICs,
   the TSSOPs, axial resistors, radial MLCCs, the J1 jumper block as on PicoGUS 2.0). Electrolytics and the pot are
   outside that area; the Pico's far end is about 2.9 mm under it (1.3 mm on v1.3.1), so with a daughterboard fitted
   solder the Pico flat or use the short Adafruit sockets. IC sockets add 4.6–5.1 mm: solder the ICs directly or
   check the clearance if the daughterboard has parts on its underside (see [Socket build](#socket-build)).
6. **Fine-pitch soldering.** U3, U4 and U9 are 0.65 mm-pitch TSSOPs soldered to the card. The hand-solder land
   pattern leaves room for an iron, and every pin has a test pad, but it needs flux, a fine tip and a magnifier.
   Check for bridges on the test pads before fitting the through-hole parts around them.
7. **RV1.** The BOM uses the Bourns PTD902-2020K-A103 (DigiKey 426, 24 kr). It has the same 2.5 mm
   pin grid and M7 bushing as the Alps RK097 the footprint was drawn for; test-fit one in the bracket
   before a large order. LCSC doesn't list it, so the LCSC column keeps the Alps RK09712200HA
   (C470545). The Alps parts (RK09712200HA: DigiKey 210 / LCSC 175, 45 kr; the switched RK0971221Z0X
   also fits) have low stock, and Alps North America has published a discontinuation notice that
   covers parts of the range.
8. **ISA bracket.** No stock bracket fits: the tabs must be 1.70 mm longer than a Keystone 9202's, and no bracket
   made for v1.2, v1.3.0, v1.3.1 or the routed v1.3.2 layout fits. Cut the four openings in the
   [Bracket](#bracket) table (and counterbore the J5/J8 holes).
9. **Mixed LCSC stand-ins.** LCSC's 3.5 mm jacks are XKB PJ-325C5 equivalents. Their unused
   TN pin sits ~0.4 mm further out, so clip it if it doesn't fit. Don't use C2910528
   (different pinout; it is in the v1.2 JLCPCB project). The Pico is not sold in the LCSC shop
   (only in the JLCPCB assembly library). DigiKey doesn't stock the APS6404L PSRAM; Adafruit 4677 (the bare chip) is
   the DigiKey source.
10. **Ferrite beads.** FB1/FB2 are axial beads on leads (DigiKey Fair-Rite 2743002112, LCSC FH
    RH3.5x0.8x9P52E). A wire link also works (MIDI out works without the beads, with slightly worse EMI).
11. The v1.2 symbols are cached in the schematic, so KiCad reports "symbol doesn't match library"
    warnings. That is expected; don't "update symbols from library" blindly.
12. Waveblaster pin 8 (MIDI out from the daughterboard) and the daughterboard audio inputs (pins 12/16)
    are not used. PicoGUS has no MIDI in.
